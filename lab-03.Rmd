### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

People- hard to understand, not even factually correct, weird cartoon people in the bottom
Data- Not presented in an accurate way
Computer- Poor graphic designer (how did they even do this)
Mathematics- Proportions aren't right





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

People- as a person, it makes me want to kill myself
Data- unclear how different variables impact the chart
Computer- likley inefficient for the computer to present variables in this manner. In other words, this is a waste of electricity and RAM.
Mathematics- no scale, unclear use of proportions. doubtful that it comes out to 100%



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

People- very unclear, hard to read countries and what graph is showing
Data-not clear what data shows
Computer - Poor showcase of data - very cluttered.
Mathematics - No clear measurements




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

People - unclear how to read the x axis or to understand which category countries fit into.
Data - doesn't portray useful information and abstractly shows developed countries to have the most money.
Computer - not too computer taxing
Mathematics - logarithmic x-axis with random placements of income instead of following a regular logarithmic pattern.




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

**What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?**

Wide data do not have repeats in the first variable. Whereas, long data do have repeats in the first column.


**Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?**

Wide.


**How many observations are there in the data set?**

5.


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
    pivot_longer(
    cols =! faculty_type, 
    names_to = "years",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

staff_long

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = years, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()



```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}

```

## Exercise 5
